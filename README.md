![[Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-master-blue.svg)](htttps://zhubonan.github.io/CellBase)

Base code and routines for building/manipulating periodic crystal structures.
Hopefully useful for more complex projects with specific applications.


## Goal

1. Ease to use - *don't make things unnecessary complex*. 
2. High performance - *when it is needed*.
3. Extensibility and flexibility.
